      warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF.  Depending on the editor you are using, a text file with LF wouldn't necessary be saved with CRLF: recent editors can preserve eol style. But that git config setting insists on changing those...  Simply make sure that (as I recommend here):  git config --global core.autocrlf false  That way, you avoid any automatic transformation, and can still specify them through a .gitattributes file and core.eol directives.
